# The Schoep Project

---

A React 18 application for Josh Schoep's resume website.

## Some features worth looking at:

- Replaced CRA with a modern Webpack 5 configuration to resolve all security issues
- Full Sass integration and clean style code
- Complete TS modulization using indexing, constants, and auto-chunking from Webpack
